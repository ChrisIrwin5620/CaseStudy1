# CaseStudy1

This is a project to show how R can clean a messy data set as well as show some conclusions about the data. We start with very messy data from the NYC housing board, in which our group was assigned the burough of Queens. We first will start with the data and create useful and useable new data set using R in order to show useful graphs and conclusions about the data.
